\subsubsection{Geometric Programming}

\textbf{Motivation}

- Summary Change of variables, transformation of objectives and constraints

\rightarrow convex problem in standard form

- Monomial function

- Posynomial function

- Problem formulation

- Example

- Technique

Variable transformation $y_i=\log{x_i}$ on objective and constraints.

- Transformation

\subsubsection{Sum of Squares}

- Polynomial Optimization

$\rightarrow f,g_i,h_i$ polynomials

General case intractable

- Nonnegative polynomials

Small adaption with \gamma

find largest \gamma such that $f(x)-\gamma$ nonnegative, NP Hard

$\rightarrow$ chose \gamma very high, results in sum of squares

\textbf{Definition}
A polynomial $f(x)$ is a sum of squares (SOS), if it can be written as
$$f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{i}^{}g_i^2(x) \quad g_i \text{: polynomial}$$

- Verification

$z(x)$ as vector that contains all polynomials of degree $\le d$

\begin{theorem}[SOS]
	$p(x)$ is an SOS if and only if $\exists\ Q$ such that $Q >=0$ and $p(x)=z(x)\T Qz(x)$
\end{theorem}

Proof

Example

\textbf{SOS for Lyapunov Stability Analysis}

Dynamic

$\dot{x}_1 = -x_1^3+x_2$

$\dot{x}_2 = -x_1-x_2$

Equilibrium


$x = (x_1,x_2) = (0,0)$

$V(x) = ax1^2+bx2^2$
vdot = dVf(x)
= [2ax1,2bx2]*dynvec

verify vx>0,-vdot>0
